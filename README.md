# Python-Text-Parser
This is a tool to parse large files of text and break them up into tokens of words using NLTK. This tool also has the capability to remove stop words from the set of word tokens, resulting in a set of word tokens which can provide realiable information about the contents of a certain text file, rather than containing unusable fluff in the form of stop words.
